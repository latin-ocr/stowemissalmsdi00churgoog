NOTE.

 

THE present volume contains a complete faesimile of the
Irish MS. known as the Stowe Missal, with the exception os
the extracts from the Gospel of St. John which occupy the first
eleven leaves. These extracts have nothing to do with the
liturgical matter which follows, and there is reason to believe
that they were only bound up with it for convenience. For
permission to reproduce the MS. the Henry Bradshaw Society
is indebted to the liberality os the Royal Irish Academy, in
whose library it is now preserved. The collotype plates, which
represent the exact sizo os the original, have been executed by
the University Press, Oxford.

A second volume will give the text of the Missal and of the
Irish treatise on the Mass at the end of it, literally transcribed,
together with an Introduction and an Index os Liturgical
Forms. Collotype reproductions of three pages of the extracts
from St. John, and of the metal case within which the MS.
is enclosed, will also be included.
